# Serra Dashboard System

Serra is a no-code distributed reactive system for building and running dashboards anywhere - from cloud to edge. At its core, it uses a Smart Plumbing system (formally known as a Constraint Propagation Network) to handle dynamic data flows and relationships.

## Overview

Think of this as a smart plumbing system where:
- Values flow like water between tanks
- Formulas act like pipes connecting tanks
- Pressure controls flow direction
- Valves can lock/unlock flow
- The system automatically balances itself

## Current Features
- Visual dashboard designer
- Real-time data flow with bidirectional computation
- Component-based architecture
- Web-based monitoring interface
- Dashboard navigation and linking
- Smart Plumbing system for automatic value propagation
- Pressure-based flow control for complex relationships
- Dynamic constraint satisfaction

## Technical Foundation

### Smart Plumbing Core
The system uses a Constraint Propagation Network (CPN) that enables:
- Bidirectional computation
- Dynamic flow control
- Pressure-based solving
- Real-time value propagation
- Automatic constraint satisfaction
- UI-ready architecture

### Implementation Details
Built using:
- RxJS for reactive streams
- Bidirectional computation graphs
- Dynamic pressure-based solving
- Real-time state management
- Event-driven architecture
- Modular component system

## Coming Soon
- Edge deployment support
- Command & control interfaces
- Multiple visualization targets:
  - Web dashboards
  - Mobile apps
  - Industrial HMIs
  - CLI outputs
- Distributed execution
- Data source connectors
- Visual flow programming
- Dashboard templates and sharing

## Architecture

### Core Model
The system's heart is a pure reactive model based on Smart Plumbing principles:
- Bidirectional data flows (like water in pipes)
- Pressure-controlled value propagation
- Dynamic constraint satisfaction
- Automatic relationship balancing
- Component relationships
- Business logic

### Smart Plumbing Components
Each component in the system can act as:
- Source (input tank)
- Destination (output tank)
- Transformer (pipe with formula)
- Controller (pressure/valve manager)
- Monitor (flow observer)

### Renderers
Multiple ways to visualize and interact with your dashboards:
- Web monitoring interface
- Command line outputs
- Industrial HMIs
- Mobile apps

### Basic Usage (AI Generated)
```javascript
const formula = createSmartPlumbing({
  tanks: { A: 0, B: 0, X: 0 },
  pipes: [{
    sources: ['A', 'B'],
    destination: 'X',
    flowForward: (a, b) => a + b,
    flowBackward: [
      (x, b) => x - b,  // solve for A
      (x, a) => x - a   // solve for B
    ]
  }]
});
```

### Advanced Usage (AI Generated)

#### Complex Flow Networks
```javascript
const network = createSmartPlumbing({
  tanks: {
    input1: { initial: 0, type: 'source' },
    input2: { initial: 0, type: 'source' },
    processor: { initial: 0, type: 'transformer' },
    output: { initial: 0, type: 'destination' }
  },
  pipes: [
    {
      sources: ['input1', 'input2'],
      destination: 'processor',
      transform: {
        forward: (a, b) => Math.max(a, b) * 1.5,
        backward: [
          (p, b) => p / 1.5,
          (p, a) => p / 1.5
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
});

## Real-World Applications

### Process Control (AI Generated)
```javascript
// Temperature control system with feedback
const tempControl = createSmartPlumbing({
  tanks: {
    setpoint: { initial: 72, type: 'source' },
    current: { initial: 68, type: 'sensor' },
    heaterPower: { initial: 0, type: 'actuator' },
    efficiency: { initial: 0.85, type: 'parameter' }
  },
  pipes: [
    {
      sources: ['setpoint', 'current', 'efficiency'],
      destination: 'heaterPower',
      transform: {
        forward: (target, actual, eff) => 
          ((target - actual) * 100) / eff,
        backward: [
          (power, current, eff) => (power * eff) / 100 + current,
          (power, setpoint, eff) => setpoint - (power * eff) / 100
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
});
```

## Advanced Topics
### Network Optimization
The Smart Plumbing system automatically optimizes flow paths by:
- Detecting and resolving circular dependencies
- Minimizing computation steps
- Balancing pressure across the network
- Caching intermediate results
- Managing backpressure

### Scaling Strategies
For large-scale deployments:

1. Hierarchical Networks
   - Segment complex systems
   - Local optimization
   - Cascading updates

2. Distributed Processing
   - Edge computation
   - Load balancing
   - Fault tolerance

3. Performance Tuning
   - Pressure threshold adjustment
   - Flow rate optimization
   - Memory management

### Security Considerations
- Flow validation
- Pressure limits
- Access control
- Audit logging
- Data encryption
- Secure deployment
